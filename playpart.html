        Peter Stockmann. Good evening, Katherine.<br>

        Mrs. Stockmann (coming forward into the sitting-room). Ah, good
        evening—is it you? How good of you to come up and see us!<br>
        
        Peter Stockmann. I happened to be passing, and so—(looks into the
        dining-room). But you have company with you, I see.<br>
        
        Mrs. Stockmann (a little embarrassed). Oh, no—it was quite by chance
        he came in. (Hurriedly.) Won't you come in and have something, too?<br>
        
        Peter Stockmann. I! No, thank you. Good gracious—hot meat at night!
        Not with my digestion.<br>
        
        Mrs. Stockmann. Oh, but just once in a way—<br>
        
        Peter Stockmann. No, no, my dear lady; I stick to my tea and bread and
        butter. It is much more wholesome in the long run—and a little more
        economical, too.<br>
        
        Mrs. Stockmann (smiling). Now you mustn't think that Thomas and I are
        spendthrifts.
