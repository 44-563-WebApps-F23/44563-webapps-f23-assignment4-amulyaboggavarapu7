       Ah, goodevening—is it you? How good of you to come up and see us!<br>

    <span class="bold">Peter Stockmann.</span>

     But you have company with you, I see.<br>

    <span class="bold">Mrs. Stockmann</span> <br>

     Oh, no—it was quite by chancehe came in.<br>
      <span class="redtext">(Hurriedly.)</span><br>
      Won't you come in and have something, too?<br>

    <span class="bold">Peter Stockmann.</span><br>

    <span class="bold">Mrs. Stockmann</span>.Oh, but just once in a way—<br>

     <span class="bold">Peter Stockmann.</span><br>
     No, no, my dear lady; I stick to my tea and bread andbutter. It is much more wholesome in the long run—and a little moreeconomical, too.<br>

    <span class="bold">Mrs. Stockmann.</span> <br>
    <span class="redtext">(smiling).</span> <br>
    Now you mustn't think that Thomas and I are spendthrifts.
